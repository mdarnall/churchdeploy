## Tweak UI ##

version 0.1.2 beta

This extension adds the following tweaks to the UI of Symphony:

- Collapsable fields in the section editor
- Removes the 'Meiryo' font from the stylesheet (and removing the annoying Yen-sign)
- Increases the length of multiselect boxes
- Replaces multiselect fields to checkboxes whereever available.
- Allows grouping of datasources

## Grouping of datasources ##

Grouping of datasources is done automaticly by the way how you name your datasources.
Practicly, group names are automaticly detected by the use of a colon in your datasource.

For example:

If you have the following datasources:

- Navigation
- Shop : Orders
- Shop : Order detail
- Shop : Products
- Shop : Product detail
- Content : Articles
- Content : Article Detail
- Content : News
- Content : News detail
- Banners

The following groups will be made:

- Uncategorized
    - Navigation
    - Banners
- Shop
    - Shop : Orders
    - Shop : Order detail
    - Shop : Products
    - Shop : Product detail
- Content
    - Content : Articles
    - Content : Article Detail
    - Content : News
    - Content : News detail
