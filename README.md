# Setup

- *Instructions are for a Mac*
- *In the future, the instructions will be abstracted to `church deploy`, instead of the `atheycreek` use-case* 

## Local environment

- Download [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- Go to the [church ensemble](https://github.com/atheycreek/church-ensemble) github project and click "Clone in Mac"
- Use `http://churchdeploy/` as your local hosting environment - We recommend [MAMP PRO](http://www.shareit.com/programs.html?productid=300169372)
- Setup a database called `churchdeploy` with the both the username and password set to `root`
    - database encoding should be `UTF-8`
- The default admin account credentials for `http://churchdeploy/symphony/`
    - **User:** admin  
    - **Password:** k42j3b42kjb
- Be sure to set all files to read/write, we recommend using [BatChMod](http://www.lagentesoft.com/batchmod/index.html) (Check all checkboxes once you have the selected directory, see [example](http://see.weareinto.com/9Q73))
